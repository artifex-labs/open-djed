# Open DJED

## What is Open DJED?

**Open DJED** is a transparent, community-driven web application for interacting with the DJED algorithmic stablecoin protocol on **Cardano**—built without the barriers of proprietary code.

Developed by **Artifex Labs**, Open DJED is the result of a deep reverse-engineering effort of the original DJED application. We've recreated the user interface and interaction logic while maintaining full protocol compatibility—then made everything open source for the entire Cardano ecosystem to explore, audit, and improve.

## Why Open DJED?

- **Protocol-compatible** – Same overcollateralized logic that powers DJED.
- **Fully open source** – All code is auditable, forkable, and community-owned.
- **Community-first** – Built for and by the Cardano community.
- **Enhanced reliability** – Alternative access during COTI app downtime or issues.
- **Global accessibility** – Available to users worldwide without geographic restrictions.
- **Transparent fees** – Follows COTI's fee structure transparently, no surcharges.
- **Lower network fees** – Optimized contracts reduce fees by ~0.1 ADA.

## Our Mission

We built Open DJED to address critical accessibility challenges with the original COTI DJED application. Recurring downtime, system issues, and geographic restrictions created barriers for legitimate users seeking to interact with the DJED protocol. Open DJED provides an alternative interface that eliminates these obstacles while maintaining full protocol compatibility.

**Artifex Labs** builds open-source, permissionless tools for the Cardano ecosystem. Open DJED is our first major release—and we're only just getting started!

Join us in reshaping DeFi on Cardano—openly, transparently, and together.
