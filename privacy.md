**Effective Date:** May 14, 2025

Artifex Labs is committed to privacy and transparency. This Privacy Policy outlines what data we collect and how it is used.

## 1. Data Collection

We do **not** collect any personal data.

### Wallets

When users interact with the app using their Cardano wallet, we interact only with the wallet interface via the CIP-30 standard. We do not receive or store your wallet address or any private keys.

## 2. Cookies

We use cookies **only** to store user preferences, such as:

- Light/dark theme selection
- Network choice (e.g., mainnet or preprod)

These cookies are **not used for tracking** and do **not** store any personally identifiable information.

## 3. Analytics and Telemetry (Planned)

We may later introduce limited analytics (e.g., PostHog or Sentry) to improve app performance and track application errors. This will be used solely to understand app usage and fix bugs.

We will update this policy before enabling any such analytics.
